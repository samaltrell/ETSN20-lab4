”The great age of Odinsfolk wanes as the tales of the heroes of old fades from memory.
I am peering over a wasteland of flesh and metal. 
Blades shattered, shields splintered, men broken. 
Colorful banners of the great nations now lay tattered in crimson blood. 
Among them I can make out the emblems of old; Fellowship, Pirates, Hunters, Rocks, and the Government of the settlers. 
So fruitless was this battle born from foolish anarchy and corruption.
Among the fallen warriors, the lifeless corpse of Siegric Haldersson towers over rest. 
Even in death he stands on his feet with a soul teeming with fighting spirit. 
He carries the last of his arsenal ready to slay dragons and wyverns for the rest of eternity. 
Now Odin’s Valkyries will take Siegric to Valheim to fight the Forsaken of dragons’ descent. 
Fader’ and Moder’s blood will stain the Dragonslayer’s blades.
The great age of Odinsfolk wanes as the tale of Siegric Dragonslayer fades from memory.”
-Uwyn Haldersson, 1085
